= Google+ Platform Hangout Sample App =

If you're reading this, you've probably taken a look at the Hangouts API
reference docs and want to get started creating your own hangout app. 

We suggest you get the Starter App up and running before you tackle
this one!

== What's Included ==
This project provides:

 - mediaStarter.xml, mediaStarter.js
   The app's XML and JavaScript

 - html5slider.js
   A shim to make range elements work on Firefox

 - various .pngs, .wavs
   Items to turn into overlays and greetings

== Using This Starter ==

Before you start modifying the provided code, it's a good idea to set up your 
hangout app. 

You need to host all of the files statically on a publicly-visible
website.  Right now, it all points to hangoutmediastarter.appspot.com,
so you may wish to edit those links.

If you modify the js, you need to change mediaStarter.xml to point to
your local .js file (not the one on hangoutmediastarter.appspot.com).
